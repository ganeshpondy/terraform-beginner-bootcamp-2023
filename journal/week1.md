# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## 1.0.0 Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
PROJECT_ROOT
│
├── main.tf                 # everything else.
├── variables.tf            # stores the structure of input variables
├── terraform.tfvars        # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
├── providers.tf            # defined required providers and their configuration
├── outputs.tf              # stores our outputs
└── README.md               # required for root modules
```

## 1.1.0 Terraform and Input Variables

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:
- Enviroment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables - those that you would normally set in your tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

## 1.2.0 Dealing With Configuration Drift

## What happens if we lose our state file?

If you lose your statefile, you most likley have to tear down all your cloud infrastructure manually.

You can use terraform port but it won't for all cloud resources. You need check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.

### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name`

[Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)
[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

``` TF
Import :

terraform import aws_s3_bucket.s3-bucket <bucketname>

terraform Import random_string.bucket_name <bucketname>

```

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone goes and delete or modifies cloud resource manually through ClickOps. 

If we run Terraform plan is with attempt to put our infrstraucture back into the expected state fixing Configuration Drift



### S3 Bucket Name Varaiable with Condition and Error Message 

``` JSON
variable "bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket"
  type        = string

  validation {
    condition     = (
      length(var.bucket_name) >= 3 && length(var.bucket_name) <= 63 && 
      can(regex("^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-.]*[a-z0-9]$", var.bucket_name))
    )
    error_message = "The bucket name must be between 3 and 63 characters, start and end with a lowercase letter or number, and can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and dots."
  }
}
```

## 1.3.0 Create module as 'terrahouse_aws'

update the output.tf in base 

```json
output "bucket_name" {
  value = module.terrahousr_aws.bucket_name
}
```
